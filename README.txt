Problems 1-3 are done in hw.py
Plots are also in the zipped folder
    Files with "P2" are for problem 2
    Files with "P3" are for problem 3
    "xy" is the path plot
    "dx" is the x trajectory plot
    "dy" is the y trajectory plot
    "angularvel" is the angular velocity plot

Problem 3's prompts are answered below

The theta for the calculation was absolute to the world coordinate system rather than the vehicle since we simply turn
the wheel toward the desired direction of travel and move angularly irrespective of the local coordinate system.
Friction and slip are real world problems that were not considered in this function. Machine tolerances are also probably
not perfect as was assumed here.
